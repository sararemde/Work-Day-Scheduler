# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
for this assignment we tasked to make a planner. This is the criteria that we need for it:

IVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## What I used
To complete this homework assignment I used jquery, bootstrap, moment,js, css, javascript and html.
